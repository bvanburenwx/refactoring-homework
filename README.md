Code Refactoring Homework

This is the first homework assignement on refactoring existing code. 

Websites are viewed by many on a daily bases. It is important as a website developer to be able to write code 
that can be viewed/understood by most. 

Semantic HTML elements help organize a website in a way that people can understand what code is going where
and what is being done in that section. 

For this assignment, I went into some provided code and added semantic HTML element to make it more readable
for viewers. I also consolidated some of the HTML and the associated CSS while not changing the presentation 
of the final product.
